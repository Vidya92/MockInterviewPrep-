# MockInterviewPrep-
MockInterview

I made up the questions in the MockInterview prep. I am a mentor for Data Circles where I am co-hosting the interview prep series. Based on demand of attendees, I design Data Science questions for practice. Currently, this contains data manipulation/aggregation/visualization samples.
